# Background
I wanted to create a reasonably landing page as a learning process.

# The key files are only:

HTML Page: index.html (includes imports using riger from whole project)

Stylesheet (built with Sass): /style/main.sass (includes imports from whole project)

# Technical Dependencies
gulp.js

# Steps to build and run locally
Clone this repository: 
git clone https://github.com/lessarea/landing_openH.git

Run npm install.

If you don't have Sass on your machine, this can be useful: 
https://sass-lang.com/install

Run gulp.

Browse to "http://localhost:9000".
